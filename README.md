# Neuran-network
It is a mini frame work for creating and training a neural network by the method of error back propagation with stochastic gradient descent for the C++ language. The  module is for designing a neural network with any number of layers of any size.

# Tests
With the help of this framework, a neural network was created to classify handwritten letters. The network was trained on a dataset of 75 immages of letters (50 x 50), in which there were 5 classes of letters (15 for each one).

Learning outcomes:

    Classification of the training sample - accuracy 100 %
    Classification of the test sample - accuracy 92 %
